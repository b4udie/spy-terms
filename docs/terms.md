Privacy Policy
Last updated: May 12, 2025

Spy: 10,000 Locations! (‚Äúwe‚Äù, ‚Äúus‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù) does not collect any logs, analytics, or personal data via sign-in. We only integrate Google AdMob for advertising. This Privacy Policy explains what advertising-related data is collected, how it is used, and your choices.

1. Data We Collect
Advertising Data (via Google AdMob):

Advertising Identifier (IDFA on iOS)

Device information: model, operating system version, language, time zone, screen resolution

Network data: IP address, connection type (Wi-Fi or cellular)

Approximate location: derived from IP address (or device location only if you grant permission)

Ad engagement: impressions, clicks, conversions

If you decline tracking under iOS ATT or disable personalized ads in your region, we will only request non-personalized ads (no IDFA access).

2. How We Use Your Data
Deliver and measure ads. Ensure you see relevant ads (if you consent) and track basic ad performance (e.g. impressions, clicks).

Non-personalized fallback. If you do not consent to tracking, you will still see ads, but they will not be targeted using your device‚Äôs advertising identifier.

5. Your Choices

6. Children‚Äôs Privacy
Our app is not directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect advertising identifiers or any data from users under 16. If you believe we have collected such data, please contact us to have it removed.
